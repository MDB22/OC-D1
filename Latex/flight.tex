In order to achieve the required flight range (up to 60km) and endurance (60 minutes), the UAV will be a hybrid aircraft, fusing both a traditional fixed-wing aircraft and a Vertical Take‚ÄêOff and Landing (VTOL) multi-rotor aircraft.  A Skywalker X8 frame is being used, with 3 motors in Y3 configuration, as shown by the prototype in Figure \ref{fig:aircraft}.\\

These motors will act as a tri-copter when in VTOL mode, with a servo mounted in the back stabilising the aircraft's yaw by controlling the back motor, offsetting the rotation caused by the 3 motors. A servo system in the front of the aircraft allows the front motors to rotate forwards, transitioning the aircraft to fixed wing flight mode. The back motor is then disengaged, and the servos controlling the ailerons are engaged.\\
