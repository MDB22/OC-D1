In order to achieve the required flight range and maneuverability to coincide with the objectives, the UAV will be a hybrid aircraft. It will be both a traditional fixed-wing aircraft and a Vertical Take‚ÄêOff and Landing (VTOL) multi-rotor aircraft.  A Skywalker X8 frame is being used, with 3 motors extruding it. These motors will act as a tri-copter when in VTOL mode, and the front motors will rotate forwards when in fixed wing flight mode. The fully assembled prototype is shown in Figure \ref{fig:aircraft}.
