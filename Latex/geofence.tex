A monitoring system will be implemented on the aircraft to detect proximity to, and crossing of, Geofence boundaries, as per 3.1.3. Although the PixHawk has inbuilt Geofence capabilities, the UAV will instead use the Raspberry Pi, as it will be at the highest level of control.\\

The PixHawk will provide the Raspberry Pi with the GPS, altimeter and accelerometer measurements, which will be used to estimate and monitor the position of the aircraft. As the Raspberry Pi is the highest level of control and autonomy onboard the aircraft, a breach of the Geofence boundary will result in the immediate disengagement of control to all subsystems, and activation of the flight termination system, detailed below.
