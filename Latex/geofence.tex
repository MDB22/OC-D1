As per 3.1.3. although the Pixhawk will be able to detect if the geofence is crossed automatically, the UAV will use the Raspberry Pi to avoid the geofences. This is because the Pi will be acting as an onboard path planner. It will have capabilites that will keep it within. If it fails to do this however, either the Pi or Pixhawk will be able to terminate the craft.
