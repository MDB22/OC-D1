There will be two options for flight termination on the completed craft. The higher level Raspberry Pi will be able to send temrination signals to the Pixhawk directly if termination is required. This will comply with either fixed wing or multi rotor temrmination requirements, depending which mode it is currently in. On a lower level, the Pixhawk will be able to automatically comply with termination requirements through a failsafe if necessary (such as crossing a geofence or losing signal).
