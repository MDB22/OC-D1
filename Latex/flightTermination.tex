As per 3.1.4. there will be two options for flight termination on the completed craft. The higher level Raspberry Pi will be able to send temrination signals to the Pixhawk directly if termination is required. This will comply with either fixed wing or multi rotor termination requirements, depending which mode it is currently in. On a lower level, the Pixhawk will be able to automatically comply with termination requirements through a failsafe if necessary (such as crossing a geofence or losing signal).

In the event that the aircraft must terminate its flight, ... as per 3.1.5.

As per 3.1.6. Flight termination will be automatically activated if the aircraft crosses a Geofence boundary, if the Geofence detection system fails, or if the autopilot has failed. Manual termination can also be activated by the controller at the request of judges/range personnel, for example, if the aircraft appears out of control.
